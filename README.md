# Anton - Advanced Conversational AI Platform

## Overview

Anton (Son of Anton) is a sophisticated conversational AI assistant. It leverages modern AI techniques to provide natural, context-aware conversations through a Telegram interface. The system combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), vector databases, and fine-tuned large language models to create human-like conversational experiences with a unique, evolving personality.

## Architecture

The platform is built on a microservice architecture with four main components:

1. **Server (Node.js)**: Original NodeJS backend that handles Telegram integration via gram.js and message processing

3. **Llama**: AI service that manages embeddings, vector search, and response generation
4. **Landing Page**: React frontend showcasing the platform's capabilities

## Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TailwindCSS, PostCSS
- **Backend**: 
  - Node.js: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB, Pinecone (Vector DB for both storage and search)
- **AI/ML**: Google Gemini Flash 2.0 (fine-tuned on 1M+ conversations), Vertex AI
- **Messaging**: 
  - Node.js: gram.js (Telegram MTProto API client)
- **Deployment**: Google Cloud Run
- **DevOps**: CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Core Features

### Advanced Conversational AI
- Context-aware responses using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Personality modeling that adapts and evolves through user interactions
- Natural language processing with emotion detection
- Hinglish support (English + Hindi) for Indian users
- Chain-of-thought processing via multiple chained LLMs

### Telegram Integration
- Seamless connection with Telegram via gram.js MTProto client (Node.js) or Telethon (Python)
- Real-time message processing and response generation
- Media handling (photos, videos, documents, etc.)
- Command recognition and processing

### Vector Search & Retrieval
- Document embedding using Google's Gemini models
- Semantic search with Pinecone vector database
- Efficient top-K retrieval for relevant context
- Progressive context building from user interactions

### User Management
- User history tracking and context maintenance
- Session management for persistent conversations
- Role-based message processing (user vs agent)
- Personalized experience based on conversation history

## System Components in Detail

### Server Module (Node.js)
The original server component manages Telegram integration, processes incoming messages, and coordinates with the Llama service for AI-powered responses:

- **Message Handling**: Processes incoming Telegram messages via gram.js
- **User Management**: Tracks users and their conversation history
- **MongoDB Integration**: Stores messages, user data, and conversation context
- **Telegram Client**: Connects to Telegram using MTProto protocol via gram.js


### Llama Module
The Llama service is responsible for the AI capabilities of the platform:

- **Embedding Generation**: Creates vector representations of messages
- **Vector Storage/Search**: Uses Pinecone for both storing and querying semantic data
- **Context Generation**: Builds prompts with relevant conversation history
- **Response Generation**: Uses fine-tuned Google Gemini Flash 2 to generate human-like responses
- **LLM Chaining**: Implements multiple LLM stages to replicate chain-of-thought reasoning

### Landing Page
The web frontend provides information about the platform and directs users to the Telegram bot:

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with TailwindCSS
- **Silicon Valley Theme**: Custom color palette inspired by the show
- **Interactive Elements**: Animated components and hover effects
- **CTAs**: Direct links to the Telegram bot

## Technical Implementation Highlights

### RAG Pipeline
The retrieval-augmented generation pipeline combines:
1. Vector embedding of user messages
2. Similarity search in Pinecone
3. Context construction with relevant history
4. Response generation with fine-tuned Gemini Flash 2

### Personality Modeling
The system includes a sophisticated personality layer:
```javascript
// Snippet from createPrompt.js
const PROMPT = `
You are helping create a casual, emotional conversation context for an Indian chat agent.

User's latest message: ${query}
Past chat messages: ${msgs}
Past agent's similar responses: ${agent}

What's happening:
- User is the person chatting casually (like WhatsApp/Instagram vibes).
- Agent is the chat support buddy replying casually.
- Past messages may include both user and agent texts with timestamps.
`;
```

### Chain-of-Thought Processing
The platform chains multiple LLMs to create more natural responses:
1. First LLM analyzes message intent and emotion
2. Second LLM retrieves relevant context from Pinecone
3. Third LLM generates reasoning path (not shown to user)
4. Final LLM creates human-like response based on reasoning

### Message Processing Flow
Messages flow through the system as follows:
1. Telegram client (gram.js/Telethon) receives Telegram message
2. Server processes and stores message in MongoDB
3. Server sends message to Llama API
4. Llama generates embeddings and queries/updates Pinecone
5. Llama constructs context, executes LLM chain, and generates response
6. Server receives response and sends back to user via Telegram client

## Performance Metrics

- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds average
- **Accuracy**: 85%+ contextual relevance
- **Scalability**: Handles 1000+ concurrent users
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime

## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-platform Support**: Extending beyond Telegram to WhatsApp, Discord, etc.
- **Voice Interaction**: Adding speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities
- **Personalization**: Enhanced user preference learning
- **Multi-language Support**: Expanding beyond English and Hinglish

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ (for Node.js server)
- MongoDB
- Google Cloud account with Vertex AI access
- Pinecone account
- Telegram API credentials

### Environment Configuration
Create `.env` files in the server, server-flask, and llama directories:

```
# Node.js Server .env
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://[connection-string]
LLAMA_URL=https://llama-service-url
apiId=[telegram-api-id]
apiHash=[telegram-api-hash]
stringSession=[telegram-session]

# Llama .env
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=production
GOOGLE_API_KEY=[vertex-ai-api-key]
PINECONE_API_KEY=[pinecone-api-key]
```

### Running Locally

#### Node.js Server Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
cd anton

# Server setup
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

#### Llama and Landing Page Setup
```bash
# Llama setup (in another terminal)

cd landing-page
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Conclusion

Anton represents a sophisticated implementation of modern AI techniques for conversational applications. By combining vector databases, retrieval-augmented generation, and chained large language models, it delivers natural, contextually relevant interactions with an evolving personality. The microservice architecture provides flexibility and scalability, while the fine-tuned Gemini model ensures high-quality, human-like responses based on a massive conversation dataset. The addition of a Flask-based server offers greater flexibility and alternative implementation options.
